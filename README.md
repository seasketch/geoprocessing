# Geoprocessing

All-in-one solution for developing low-cost and low-maintenance geoprocessing functions and reports for the web, with Typescript. Simplified publish to cloud with auto-scaling to meet high demand.

This framework is part of the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org) ecosystem.

- [Releases](https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing/releases)

## Who is this framework for?

This framework is primarily designed for people that want to create and host their own geoprocessing functions and reports and plug them into their SeaSketch project, though it is not dependent on SeaSketch. It is used for all SeaSketch [projects](https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMTc3OTQ1NDg5).

## Goals

- [Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/serverless-architectures-learn-more/) architecture that scales up to meet high demand, then scales down to near zero cost when not in use.
- First-class [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) development experience.
- [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) environment for writing reports.
- Utilize cloud-optimized data formats including [Flatgeobuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/) and [Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)](https://www.cogeo.org/)
- Open source BSD license
