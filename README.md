# Geoprocessing

A framework for publishing low-cost and low-maintenance `geoprocessing` services and reports in the cloud.  Part of the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org/) ecosystem.

It works best where the same analysis needs to be run many times with different input by a large diverse group of users, as is often the case with spatial planning processes.  The original analysis may be prototyped in an environment like R, Jupyter Notebook, ArcGIS Desktop, etc. and this framework can be used to "operationalize" the analysis at a speed and cost that can't be achieved with other solutions.

## Who is this for?

It's specifically targeted to GIS practictioners, developers, and technical folks that want to create and host geoprocessing projects themselves, independent of any planning tool used. The SeaSketch team uses it for [all projects](https://github.com/mcclintock-lab?q=-next&type=&language=&sort=)

## Goals

* Easy to create and publish a geoprocessing project (with datasets, functions, and client reports) in the cloud
* Plug-and-play with the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org) platform using standardized APIs
* Spins up to meet high demand, then spins down to near zero cost when not in use.

## Features

* Core library with command-line interface (CLI) for managing geoprocessing projects, and a straightforward upgrade path to new versions.
* [Docker workspace](https://hub.docker.com/u/seasketch) packed with open source tools like PostGIS, OGR, GDAL for scripting data prep workflows.
* Toolbox of geoprocessing functions suited for spatial planning.
* Library of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components ready to add to report clients.
* [Templates](#Templates) for common planning use cases that can be installed into your project.
* Cloud-optimized tools for indexing large data and using in analysis
* Cloud-native serverless architecture with automated provisioning and migration as a project evolves.
* APIs for accessing project resources and integration including REST, Web Socket, and IFrame postMessage.

## System Components

Geoprocessing projects consist of [geoprocessing](./docs/geoprocessing.md) or [preprocessing](./docs/preprocessing.md) functions, client javascript components and data prep scripts. Functions are bundled into services that are deployed to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). The advantage of running on lambda is that costs are based directly on use, and are typically very low compared to a server running 24/7. They also scale up to hundreds of simulateous users very quickly. Client code is stored on AWS S3 and distributed via CloudFront. The SeaSketch platform runs these report clients inside a sandboxed iframe to protect user data.

![Architecture overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511063/79143180-a1f22980-7d71-11ea-8624-6aacb73b94f3.png)

All the infrastructure pictured above is created for each geoprocessing project implementation. Resources are not shared in order to avoid issues of version mismatches and so that report authors can deploy to their own AWS account.

## Getting started

## Creating a new project

Use the init command to create a new project
```sh
npx @seasketch/geoprocessing init
```

This will download the framework, prompt you for project metadata, and then prompt you for which templates you would like to install.  Templates are sets of ready-to-use geoprocessing functions and clients using pre-compiled datasets.  You can extend them, install them at a later time, or quickly remove them if unused.  Finally, your new codebase will be initialized.

Each geoprocessing project you create may contain multiple data preparation routines, functions, and  report clients. For the most part it makes sense to create one new geoprocessing project for each SeaSketch project.

## Templates

Templates are bite-sized bundles that can be installed into your project to get you going quickly.  Dependening on their purpose they may include data prep scripts, geoprocessing functions, and report clients.

After creating your project you can add templates at any time by running:
```sh
geoprocessing add:template
```

This will copy template files directly into your project.  If there happens to be a naming collision, for example if you attempt to install a template twice, then you will get an error and the installation will stop.

Available templates include:
* [`gp-area`](packages/gp-area/README.md)
* [`gp-clip-bbox`](packages/gp-clip-bbox/README.md)
* [`gp-clip-ocean`](packages/gp-clip-ocean/README.md)
* [`gp-raster-stats`](packages/gp-raster-stats/README.md)

## Upgrading

When you create a geoprocessing project, it will be pinned to a specific version of the geoprocessing library in package.json.  You can update to the latest by running:

```sh
npm update @seasketch/geoprocessing@latest
```

You should then run `npm test` and `npm build` to see if anything is broken.  As long as this project is below version 1.0 then there could be breaking changes at any time but it should be limited to minor release increments (0.x) and not point releases (0.x.y).  Consults the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for tips on where to look, and what new features you can now take advantage of.

## Configuring your editor

The first version of @seasketch/geoprocessing support *only* Typescript and having an appropriately setup editor is crucial to taking advantage of this system. It is highly recommended you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Projects are automatically initialized with settings in `.vscode`, and when prompted you should choose to *Install All* extensions for the best development experience.

## Populating the project with example inputs

Before working on any code your first step should be populating the project with example sketches. When added, your unit tests will automatically be run against these shapes and the client authoring environment will show them while working on ui outputs. These examples should be encoded as GeoJSON and can be downloaded from SeaSketch by using the *Export GeoJSON* context menu action.

```
  /examples/
    sketches/ # <-- examples used by geoprocessing functions
    features/ # <-- examples used by preprocessing functions
```

It's easy to generate these examples using SeaSketch, so be sure to make lots of examples that cover all edge cases. Will your function work with both Sketches and Sketch Collections? Then include both types. Maybe even include Sketches outside the project bounds to make sure error conditions are handled appropriately.

## Creating a geoprocessing function

Geoprocessing projects have a number of npm scripts available. Run `npm run create:function`, and choose "Geoprocessing" for the function type. After following the prompts a template function implementation and unit test file will appear under `src/functions`, as well as a new entry in `geoprocessing.json`. Run `npm test` to run these new unit tests against your examples and verify the initialization of the project if you'd like.

To implement the geoprocessing function, modify the template to incoporate new spatial operations or data. The framework expects your function to accept a Sketch or Sketch Collection (GeoJSON will certain required properties), and it can return any json-serializable object. It can be very helpful to implement a Typescript interface definition to help debug your function and aid the development of the report client ui, and the template includes such a definition to start with.

### Preparing data for geoprocessing

Implementing geoprocessing for vector data typically will involve data encoded as GeoJSON for use with libraries such as [turf](https://turfjs.org/) and [martinez-polygon-clipping](https://github.com/w8r/martinez). The efficiency of functions is largely determined by how these data are represented. Here are a few important points to keep in mind when preparing data:

  * Lambda functions are limited to 3gb of memory, max
  * Lambda "cold-starts" will start to slow with bundle sizes > 1-2 MB
  * A decimal precision of 6 digits in GeoJSON represents 10 cm of resolution (Anything higher is a waste, but by default most datasets are wasteful)
  * A large driver of size in many datasets is often the complex shoreline, which may be simplified without harm in some cases.

Projects start with a location under `data/` designed to facilitate workflows to turn raw data into efficient encodings for use with lambda functions. It includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose setup with a PostGIS database and OGR/GDAL tools that can run data prep tasks without dependence on the configuration of the author's desktop machine. More details on this setup can be found in the [data/README.md](https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing/blob/master/packages/geoprocessing/templates/project/data/README.md) file.

#### Packaging data with lambda vs serving over the network

For small datasets there's no need to complicate deployment. GeoJSON encodings of these data can be directly imported as a module and the framework will bundle these data into the lambda javascript code using webpack.

```ts
import ports from "../../data/dist/ports.json"; // 12kB
```

When building lambda functions, the system will warn when the bundle size exceeds 500kB and that threshold can be reached very quickly. Exceeding these guidelines may mean increasingly slower cold-starts.  The limit may be closer to multiple megabytes now. Cold starts occur when the AWS Lambda system starts a new Lambda instance rather than reusing one already in memory and ready to go. With even a 30mb file this can take longer than 10 seconds.

The solution for large datasets is to subdivide them into reasonably sized chunks stored in network storage (s3), create an spatial index of bundle locations, and then have Lambda functions load just the subset of the data they need for analysis in a particular region. Geoprocessing function handlers can then use these data services by creating a new `VectorDataSource`.  Instances of `VectorDataSource` can efficienctly fetch files for a bounding box and even cache them for use in requests for nearby regions.

#### Deploying raster data for use in reports

Most raster datasets will require separate processing and uploading to s3 for use within geoprocessing functions. Rasters should be converted to cloud optimized geotiffs (COGs) that can be retrieved in an efficient manner from cloud storage. Converting a geotif to a COG can be done by using gdal libraries. An example of this process can be [found here](https://github.com/mcclintock-lab/bermuda-next-reports/blob/master/data/prep_bathymetry_raster_data.sh). (NOTE: the raster functionality uses the geoblaze.js library, which does not currently support COGs, so the full raster will be downloaded for processing. Running the COG conversion is still useful, though, for when COGs are fully supported in the code). 

### Running unit tests

When generating geoprocessing function templates using npm scripts, two test files will also be created (e.g. `functions/myFunctionSmoke.test.ts` and `functions/myFunctionUnit.test.ts` ). The smoke tests have 2 objectives: make sure your function exists and write out the results of the runs with the example sketches. The unit tests execute the functions and can be used to test correct output values. All unit tests can be run using `npm test`. This template by default will run your function against all sketches in `examples/sketches` and save the output to `examples/output`, which will be used when debugging the geoprocessing clients. 

Be default, each smoke test will be added to the @smoke group, and unit tests will be added to the @unit group. (Groups are specified in the docstring at the top of the file). To pass flags from npm to jest during tests, separate the npm test command from the jest flags using '--'. For example, to run just the smoke or unit test groups, you can send the --group flag to jest:

```bash
npm test -- --group=smoke #run only the smoke tests in a project
```

You can also run a target test by using the -t option, for example, running just a test called 'areaTest':
```bash
npm test -- -t=areaTest #run target test 'areaTest'
```

### Debugging unit tests

Each project you create includes a debug launcher which is useful for debugging your function.  With the geoprocessing repo checked out and open in VSCode, just add a breakpoint or a `debugger` call in one of your tests or in one of your functions, click the `Debug` menu in the left toolbar (picture of a bug) and select the appropriate package.  The debugger should break at the appropriate place.

## Creating a geoprocessing client

Client report UI's are React components that run in iframes within SeaSketch. To generate a new report, run `npm run create:client`. This will create a template under `src/clients/` along with a simple unit test and entry in `geoprocessing.json`. 

The framework uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to provide a environment to test your client using the results of your geoprocessing functions run on `examples/sketches`. To start, run `npm run storybook`. Be sure to run `npm test` to generate or update test outputs before using the storybook.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build # first create lambda and client bundles
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile npm run deploy # deploy using aws credentials
```

After running deploy the service metadata endpoint will be shown. This can be referenced when linking to SeaSketch.

## Integration with SeaSketch

You will need the url shown after deploying the project, or need to retrieve it using `AWS_PROFILE=my-profile npm run url`. This url, along with the name of the report client, can be entered into the Sketch Class admin interface.

# Contributing

To contribute to @seasketch/geoprocessing please create a new branch for feature work and a pull request when ready to merge into master. Setting up your development environment as detailed below will make for a smoother process.

## Quickstart

* `npm install` - installs dependencies and runs postinstall scripts for all packages using `lerna bootstrap`
* `npm test` - runs test suite for all packages
* `npm run clean` - clean up build artifacts by recursively removing files and directories not under version control including git ignored files.

## Installation

This repository is setup as a "monorepo" managed by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), with two packages under `packages/`. These include the geoprocessing library itself and an example project that can be used to test functionality. To work on the library, checkout the repo and run the install script.  This will install lerna, bootstrap each package, and prepare an initial build of the geoprocessing library.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing.git
cd geoprocessing
npm install
```

You should now be able to run unit tests for all packages
```sh
npm run test
```

## Editor setup and style guidelines

You can use whatever code editor you want, however [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides some nice nice features for Typescript development and this project is configured to take advantage of them.  To start using them, simply open the root folder of this repo in VS Code.
* autocompletion
* built-in type docs
* hide generated files
* run build steps, etc
* geojson file Intellisense and error detection - open a file and hover over features and red error squiggles to get information

### Extensions

A number of VSCode extensions are also recommended by the workspace for installation.  If you are not prompted to install, you will need to go to the Extensions screen and look for the `Workspace recommended`.  You can filter for this.

![Install All extensions screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511063/79138662-be8a6380-7d69-11ea-96f4-20a759192434.png)

* TSLint - provides 
* Prettier - automatic code formatting on save
* Map preview - open a geojson file and click the globe icon to view the features on a map in another vscode tab

## Make code changes

Any changes you make to the Typescript code in `src` won't be reflected in the Javascript code in `dist` until you compile it.  You can do this a few different ways.  Watch modes are useful for active development, new changes will be compiled automatically as you go.

VS Code - Press Command+Shift+B to open the build menu
* `geoprocessing build` - build core library
* `geoprocessing build scripts` - build scripts only
* `geoprocessing watch` - build core library and watch for changes
* `geoprocessing watch scripts` - build scripts only and watch for changes

CLI - from packages/geoprocessing folder
* `npm run prepare` - compile core Typescript library and scripts using `tsc`.  Also runs automatically on initial install and publish
* `npm run watch` - build core library and watch for changes
* `npm run watch:scripts` - build scripts only and watch for changes

## Debugging

The geoprocessing library and example-project both provide debug launchers for their test suite, just as the project template does.  With the geoprocessing repo checked out and open in VSCode, just add a breakpoint or a `debugger` call in one of the core tests, click the `Debug` menu in the left toolbar (picture of a bug) and select the appropriate package.  The debugger should break at the appropriate place.

### Debugging Functions

As you build report functions, using console logging or inspecting with a VSCode debugger may not be enough.  You may want to make sure the output is properly formatted JSON/GeoJSON, or looks appropriate on a map, or try using the file in another software library. Here's a simple workflow that can make this easier:
* Write a unit test that calls your function
* In your function, use the `toJsonFile` helper to write out any Javascript object to a nicely formatted file.
* If you output a `.geojson` file you can open it in vscode, check for errors, and view it using the Map Preview extension.
* Make any necessary changes to your code and run the test again to regenerate the files.
* Clean up your temporary files when done

## Storybook components

The framework has it's own storybook project that can be launched using `npm run storybook`. These components and their stories can be found under `packages/geoprocessing/components/`. As common ui patterns are developed the intention is to create a library of useful components with good documentation that report authors can use.

## Testing integration with project implementations

Testing modifications to the framework, particularly build steps, can be tricky because of the varying environments under which the code may run. A good methodology is to first create unit tests and verify that they run, then modify `packages/example-project` and its unit tests and verify the tests run and `npm run build` steps work. It is not uncommon for these steps to pass and for bugs to still appear after publishing of the framework, so manual testing after publishing should be done as well.

To test with projects other than `example-project` on your local machine, npm link is a handy tool. From within `packages/geoprocessing` run the command `npm link`. This will make the library available to other packages locally (assuming the same version of node. watch out nvm users!). Then change to you project directory and run `npm link @seasketch/geoprocessing`. Any changes you make to the library will automatically be reflected in your geoprocessing implementation. Just watch out for a couple common problems:

  1. Make sure VSCode is running the two build processes, and they complete without errors. Implementations import code from `dist/`, not the source typescript files.
  2. Running npm install within your geoprocessing project can interact oddly with npm link and produce errors. If you suspect problems redo the linking process again after all your installs. You will need to run `npm unlink @seasketch/geoprocessing --no-save` in your project directory.  You can then try and relink.
  
  Further link troubleshooting steps:
  * If still issue you can fully unlink and relink the geoprocessing project as a global npm package. `npm unlink @seasketch/geoprocessing` in the geoprocessing package.  If you run `npm list -g --depth 0` and still see the geoprocessing package globally then also run `npm unlink -g @seasketch/geoprocessing`.  Now follow the complete steps again to relink.
  * If still issue, then consider also deleting your `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file in your project directory to start fresh as they may have been put into an incosistent state by the linking.

## Publishing

To publish a new release of the framework, make sure you are in the `master` branch with no outstanding code changes. Then run the following:
```sh
npm run publish:stable
```

Please follow [semantic versioning conventions](https://semver.org/).  This will generate new build artifacts in the `dist` folder first using the `prepare` script.

### Alpha releases

By default, a release will be tagged as `latest` so that users installing from npm will get it by default.  You can also publish an `alpha` release out-of-band to offer new features out for early testing/adoption.

```sh
npm run publish:alpha
```
