# data/dist

Contains datasets, that have been imported into the project, transformed into a cloud-optimized format and are ready for publishing. The `data:import` command will manage populating this directory. If you want to start over with a clean slate you can delete all the files in `dist` and run the `reimport:data` command to repopulate.
