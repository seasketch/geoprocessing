The scripts directory contains single-use scripts that can be run from the root of your project directory.  Each script usually accepts one or more command line arguments so read its docs to learn more.  For example:

```bash
npm run ts-node scripts/genRandomSketches.ts
```

```bash
npm run ts-node scripts/genRandomSketches.ts 10
```
