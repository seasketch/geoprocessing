# Components

Components are the building blocks of report clients.  They are small and often reusable UI elements.  They can be top-level ReportPage components, ResultCard components within a page that invoke geoprocessing functions and display the results, or much lower level components like custom Table or Chart components.  You choose how to build them up into sweet report goodness.

As you create project components, think about whether they should be contributed up to the core UI component library published by the geoprocessing library, so that other projects can make use of them.
