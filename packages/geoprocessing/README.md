# Geoprocessing

A framework for publishing low-cost and low-maintenance `geoprocessing` services and reports in the cloud.  Part of the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org/) ecosystem.

It works best where the same analysis needs to be run many times with different input by a large diverse group of users, as is often the case with spatial planning processes.  The original analysis may be prototyped in an environment like R, Jupyter Notebook, ArcGIS Desktop, etc. and this framework can be used to "operationalize" the analysis at a speed and cost that can't be achieved with other solutions.

## Who is this for?

It's specifically targeted to GIS practictioners, developers, and technical folks that want to create and host geoprocessing projects themselves, independent of any planning tool used. The SeaSketch team uses it for [all projects](https://github.com/mcclintock-lab?q=-next&type=&language=&sort=)
