# @seasketch/geoprocessing

The geoprocessing framework allows you to create and publish individual geoprocessing `functions` and accompanying `client` UIs using Amazon S3 and Lambda.  It is designed to integrate with the [Seasketch](https://seasketch.org/) platform supporting continuous evaluation of user-designed planning areas (sketches) against science-based criteria.
