# data-builder

This folder is used for creating the quad_10 test dataset, which has data in multiple quadrants.

The QGIS project in this folder was used to generate quad_10.tif and quad_10_cog.tif from polygons. The polygons are created in web mercator to produce cells with a known area and then reprojected to 4326.

Includes test data in 4 difference quadrants. This project is here so that quad10 can be changed and re-exported if needed.
