# Default project configuration

* The `project` folder contains a starter project configuration.  When a user `init`'s a new project, it gets copied over.  This folders project client will show some import errors.  This is expected, because the imports are designed to work, once the files are copied to a users project.
* For internal testing, the outer `defaultProject` folder exports a default `testProject` with sane defaults.
