// scripts/ has its own tsconfig because it needs to be compiled to commonjs
// these utilities will be used to run tests, compile builds, and do tasks
// from node. Integrating with node is just easier using commonjs. Projects are
// expected to be tested in a version supported by Lambda for compatibility.
// The rest of @seasketch/geoprocessing will be compiled using esm to support
// better tree-shaking when creating lambda and client bundles.
